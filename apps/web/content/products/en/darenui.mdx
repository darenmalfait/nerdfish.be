I built NerdfishUI to solve my own component needs - a collection of React components that are both beautiful and practical. Instead of piecing together different libraries, I created a cohesive set of components that work seamlessly together.

## What it does

- **Modern Design**: Clean, accessible components with a focus on user experience
- **TypeScript First**: Full type safety and excellent developer experience
- **Tailwind Integration**: Built on top of Tailwind CSS for easy customization
- **Dark Mode**: Built-in dark mode support for all components
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first approach with responsive design patterns
- **Accessible**: WCAG compliant components out of the box

## Key Components

- **Layout Components**: Grid, Container, and Stack for consistent spacing
- **Form Elements**: Input, Select, Checkbox with built-in validation
- **Navigation**: Breadcrumbs, Tabs, and Navigation components
- **Feedback**: Toast, Alert, and Modal components
- **Data Display**: Table, Card, and List components

Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, this component library helps me build consistent and beautiful interfaces quickly. It's open source and free to use.
