I built Remmy to solve a personal pain point: inconsistent invoice file naming. As a freelancer, I needed a better way to organize my invoices, so I created this desktop app that makes the process much smoother.

## What it does

- **Smart VAT Number Detection**: Scans documents for VAT numbers and looks them up in the Belgian Crossroads Bank for Enterprises
- **Intelligent Field Extraction**: Pre-fills document information based on detected VAT numbers
- **Customizable Naming Schemes**: Define your own file naming patterns using variables like company name, date, invoice number, and more
- **Preview Changes**: See how files will be renamed before applying changes
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## How I use it

1. Select a file I want to rename
2. Remmy scans the document for VAT numbers
3. If it finds a VAT number, it automatically retrieves company information
4. The app pre-fills relevant fields based on the document content
5. I review and adjust the information if needed
6. Apply the new naming scheme to my file

Built with Electron and TypeScript, this tool has become an essential part of my document management workflow. It's open source.
