I built Todoist Rescheduler to solve a personal pain point: the stress of seeing overdue tasks turn red in Todoist. Instead of letting tasks pile up as overdue, this GitHub Action automatically moves them to today's tasks, creating a more forgiving and productive workflow.

## What it does

- **Automatic Task Rescheduling**: Moves overdue tasks to today instead of leaving them marked as overdue
- **GitHub Action Integration**: Runs automatically on a schedule you define
- **Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box with just your Todoist API token
- **Customizable**: Optionally filter which tasks get rescheduled
- **Free to Use**: Open source and runs on GitHub's free tier

## How it works

1. Set up the GitHub Action with your Todoist API token
2. Configure the schedule (e.g., run daily at midnight)
3. The action finds all overdue tasks
4. Automatically moves them to today's tasks
5. Keeps your Todoist clean and stress-free

Built with TypeScript and GitHub Actions, this tool helps maintain a more forgiving task management system. It's open source and free to use.
