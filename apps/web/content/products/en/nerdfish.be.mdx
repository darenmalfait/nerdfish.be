This is my personal website and digital playground where I showcase my work and experiment with new technologies. It serves as both a professional portfolio and a testing ground for innovative web development ideas.

## What it does

- **Personal Branding**: Showcases my services, projects, and professional experience
- **Project Showcase**: Features detailed information about my open-source projects and commercial work
- **Technology Playground**: Serves as a sandbox for testing new web technologies and design patterns
- **Blog Platform**: Hosts technical articles and insights about software development
- **Open Source**: The entire codebase is open source, allowing others to learn from and contribute to the project

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript for robust, type-safe development
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for modern, responsive design
- **Content**: MDX for flexible content management

The website is continuously evolving as I experiment with new features and technologies. Feel free to explore the source code on GitHub and contribute to its development.
