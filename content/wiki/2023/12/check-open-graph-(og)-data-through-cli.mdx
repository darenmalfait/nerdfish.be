Original documentation: [https://github.com/almonk/ogpk](https://github.com/almonk/ogpk)

## Install

```bash
brew tap almonk/ogpk
brew install ogpk
```

## Usage

If the optional dependency \`timg\` is installed, \`ogpk\` can also display the \`og\:image\` directly in the terminal.

To fetch OpenGraph data from a website:

```bash
ogpk [URL]
```

To display the `og:image` in the terminal (requires `timg`):

```bash
ogpk [URL] --p
```

Output data as JSON:

```bash
ogpk [URL] --json
```

## Optional Dependency on `timg`

ogpk has an optional dependency on `timg`, a terminal image viewer. If `timg` is installed and available in the `PATH`, ogpk can display the `og:image` directly in the terminal when the `--p` flag is used.

To install `timg`, refer to its [official documentation](https://github.com/hzeller/timg).
