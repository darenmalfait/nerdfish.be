  Query and apply The Website Specification — a platform-agnostic specification
  of what a good website does, with each item tagged required, recommended,
  optional, or avoid. Use when the user asks what their site should have,
  whether something is required, how to audit a URL, what's missing for agent
  readiness, or anything else where you'd otherwise be guessing at web best
  practice. Backs answers with primary sources (WHATWG, W3C, IETF RFCs, IANA,
  WCAG). Available as Markdown over HTTP and as an MCP server with search, list,
  fetch, checklist, and audit tools.

# specification.website

The Website Specification is a single source of truth for what a good website
does. Ten categories, 168 pages, every item tagged with a status. It ships in
three machine-readable forms: per-page Markdown, llms.txt / llms-full.txt, and
an MCP server.

## When to use this skill

- The user asks "what should my site have", "is X required", "audit this URL",
  "what does the spec say about Y", or anything similar.
- You're reviewing a site and want to cite primary standards rather than vendor
  blog posts.
- You need a machine-readable contract for a platform-agnostic audit.

## Quickest path — MCP

If you can speak MCP, use it. The server is stateless Streamable HTTP, no auth,
wide-open CORS.

- Endpoint: `https://mcp.specification.website/mcp`
- Server card: `https://specification.website/.well-known/mcp/server-card.json`
- Protocol revision: 2026-07-28
- Also answers the handshake-based revisions 2025-11-25, 2025-06-18 and
  2025-03-26 via `initialize`, so older clients keep working unchanged

| `get_changes({ since?, type?, limit? })`      | What changed since a date — new pages, status promotions, rewrites, removals — each resolved to the current topics to re-audit. |

Prompt: `audit_url(url, focus?)` — generates an audit plan for a target URL
against the spec, optionally narrowed to one category.

## Without MCP — fetch Markdown directly

Every spec page has a canonical HTML URL and a Markdown variant.

- HTML: `https://specification.website/spec/<category>/<slug>/`
- Markdown (file extension):
  `https://specification.website/spec/<category>/<slug>.md`
- Markdown (content negotiation): set `Accept: text/markdown` on the HTML URL.
  Middleware serves the Markdown body from that same URL with `200`,
  `Content-Location` pointing at the `.md` variant, and `Vary: Accept`. There is
  no redirect to follow.

Every Markdown response carries RFC 9530 integrity fields, so you can verify
what you fetched:

```
Content-Digest: sha-256=:<base64>:
Repr-Digest:    sha-256=:<base64>:
```

Both cover the exact bytes you received. Send `Want-Content-Digest: sha-512=10`
to get SHA-512 instead. HTML responses carry no digest. This applies to the
per-page `.md` endpoints, `llms.txt`, and `checklist.md`.

Site-wide indexes:

- `https://specification.website/llms.txt` — every page as `title — summary`
  lines. Cheap to load.
- `https://specification.website/llms-full.txt` — every page concatenated as
  Markdown. Use for one-shot context loading.
- `https://specification.website/rss.xml` — feed of changes.
- `https://specification.website/sitemap-index.xml` — every URL.
- `https://specification.website/.well-known/api-catalog` — RFC 9727 link set of
  every machine-readable endpoint.

## Categories

The category slug is part of the URL. Current slugs:

- `foundations` — HTML, head, document basics.
- `seo` — robots.txt, sitemaps, canonicals, structured data.
- `accessibility` — WCAG-aligned rules.
- `security` — headers, transport, policies.
- `well-known` — standard paths under `/.well-known/`.
- `agent-readiness` — making the site legible to AI agents and crawlers
  (llms.txt, MCP, content signals, link headers, markdown source endpoints).
- `performance` — Core Web Vitals, caching, images, fonts.
- `privacy` — consent, signals, respecting visitor choice.
- `resilience` — error pages, offline, redirects.
- `i18n` — language, locale, direction, translated content.

Call `get_categories()` for the live list with counts.

## Statuses — the contract

The `status` field on every page is the bar.

- **required** — the platform contract breaks without it. Lead with these when
  recommending fixes. Examples: `<title>`, `<meta charset>`, HTTPS, image alt
  text, a real 404.
- **recommended** — a modern site should do it. Examples: CSP, HSTS, structured
  data, Open Graph, llms.txt.
- **optional** — depends on context.
- **avoid** — outdated or harmful. If a site does one of these, flag it.

The bar for `required` is "the platform breaks", not "we strongly suggest". When
summarising, never silently upgrade `recommended` to `required`.

## Common workflows

**"Audit this URL."** Call the `audit_url` prompt for a plan, or fetch
`get_checklist({ status: "required" })` and walk the user through verifying each
item. For deeper audits, also pull `status: "recommended"`.

**"What's required for agent readiness?"**
`list_topics({ category: "agent-readiness", status: "required" })`, then
`get_topic` for each.

**"Why does the spec say X?"** Every page has 2–4 primary `sources` in its
frontmatter. Quote those, not the spec page itself.

**"Is there a category for Y?"** `get_categories()` first; if nothing fits,
`search(query)` across the corpus.

## Pairing with the MDN MCP

This spec answers **what** a good site should do and **whether** it is required.
It does not document how each web feature works or how widely it is supported.
For that, pair it with the **MDN MCP server** (`https://mcp.mdn.mozilla.net/` —
free, no auth), which serves MDN documentation and Baseline / Browser
Compatibility Data.

The two compose cleanly in an audit or build:

1. Use this spec to decide **what to check and when it is required** —
   `get_checklist`, `list_topics`, or the `audit_url` prompt.
2. For each web-platform feature that surfaces, call the MDN MCP for **how to
   implement it and whether it is safe to ship** (Baseline status, browser
   support).

So: _specification.website tells you `Content-Security-Policy` is recommended
and why; the MDN MCP tells you which directives are Baseline and how to write
them._ Keep the roles distinct — don't ask this spec for browser-support data,
and don't ask MDN whether a convention is required for a good site.

## Staying current — re-audit only what moved

The spec changes often, especially **agent-readiness**. Don't re-audit a site
from scratch every time, and don't trust a cached copy of the spec — check the
delta:

1. After an audit, store the spec's latest change date. With MCP,
   `get_changes()` returns it as `latest`; otherwise note the date you ran.
2. Next time, call `get_changes({ since: <that date> })`. It returns only the
   new pages, status promotions/downgrades, rewrites, and removals since then,
   each already resolved to the current topics (with their current status and
   URL).
3. Re-audit just those topics — `get_topic` each, then re-check the target site.

Without MCP, the same typed history is the changelog RSS feed at
`https://specification.website/changelog/rss.xml` (entries tagged added /
changed / status / removed, with the affected slugs). Poll it and act on new
entries.

A sensible default cadence is **monthly**, or at the start of any fresh audit. A
status promotion (e.g. a topic moving to `required`) can change a previously
passing site into a failing one, so a delta check is worth doing even when no
new pages were added.

## When a topic is absent

Absence is not always an oversight. `https://specification.website/considered/`
lists standards that were evaluated and deliberately left out, each with a
reason — `too-early` (final, but nothing implements it), `out-of-scope` (a way
of building a site, not something a site does), `too-narrow` (real, but applies
to too few sites) — and with what would reverse the decision.

Check it before concluding the spec has a gap, and before recommending that a
topic be added. If the topic is listed, the useful contribution is evidence that
its stated revisit condition has now been met, not a fresh proposal.
